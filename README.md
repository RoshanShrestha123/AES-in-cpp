## Weekend Project

### Rijndael encryption algorithm (Advance Encryption Algorithm) on C++ [Work in progress]

This weekend i have been doing research on how the AES works behind the scene. Trying to replicate the Algorithm on the C++ here.

**`Progress`** : ~15%
**`Energy Drain`**: ~99%

Feel free to clone & contribute! But heads up! Messy code (WIP) ahead.
